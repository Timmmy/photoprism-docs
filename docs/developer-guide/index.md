# Every Contribution Makes a Difference

We welcome contributions of any kind, including blog posts, tutorials, testing, writing documentation, and pull requests.

## Our Milestones ##

## Upcoming Features and Enhancements ##

The [public roadmap](https://link.photoprism.app/roadmap) shows what tasks are in progress, what needs testing, and which features are going to be implemented next.

You are welcome to [submit specific feature requests](issues.md) after you have verified that [no similar issue](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/idea) already exists. Give ideas you like a thumbs-up üëç  , so that we know what is most popular.

## Join the Community ##

Follow us on [Mastodon](https://floss.social/@photoprism), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/photoprism.app), or join the [Community Chat](https://link.photoprism.app/chat) to get regular updates, connect with other users, and discuss your ideas. Our [Code of Conduct](https://www.photoprism.app/code-of-conduct) explains the "dos and don‚Äôts" when interacting with other community members.

As a contributor, you are also welcome to [contact us directly](https://www.photoprism.app/contact) if you have something on your mind that you don't want to discuss publicly. Please note, however, that due to the high volume of emails we receive, our team may be unable to get back to you immediately. We do our best to respond within five business days or less.

## Creating Bug Reports ##

Before [reporting a bug](https://www.photoprism.app/kb/reporting-bugs), first use our [Troubleshooting Checklists](../getting-started/troubleshooting/index.md) to determine the cause of your problem. If you have a general question, need help, it could be a configuration issue, or a misunderstanding in how the software works:

- you are welcome to ask in our [Community Chat](https://link.photoprism.app/chat)
- or post your question in [GitHub Discussions](https://link.photoprism.app/discussions)

In order for us to process [new bug reports](https://www.photoprism.app/kb/reporting-bugs), they must include the steps to reproduce the problem, the software versions being used and information about the environment in which the problem occurred, such as [browser type, browser version, browser plug-ins](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/browsers/), operating system, [storage type](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/performance/#storage), [processor type](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/performance/#server-cpu), and [memory size](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/performance/#memory).

A template for creating bug reports can be found at [photoprism.app/kb/reporting-bugs](https://www.photoprism.app/kb/reporting-bugs). We kindly ask you not to report bugs via [GitHub Issues](issues.md) **unless you are certain to have found a fully reproducible and previously unreported issue** that must be fixed directly in the app.

    When [browsing issues](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues), please note that **our team and all issue subscribers receive an email notification** from GitHub whenever a new comment is added, so these should only be used for sharing important information and not for [discussions, questions](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/discussions), or [expressing personal opinions](https://www.photoprism.app/code-of-conduct).Thank you very much!

## Submitting Pull Requests ##

Follow our [step-by-step guide](pull-requests.md) to learn how to submit new features, bug fixes, and documentation enhancements.

Pull requests solving ["help wanted"](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/help%20wanted) issues are the easiest to merge and the most helpful to us, as they allow us to spend more time on core functionality and other issues that are difficult for external contributors to work on. If you are new to this project, anything labeled ["easy"](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/easy) may be a good first contribution.

**Be aware that reviewing, testing and finally merging pull requests requires significant resources on our side. It can therefore take several months if it is not just a small fix, especially if extensive testing is needed to prevent bugs from getting into our stable version.**

!!! example "Privacy Notice"
    We operate a number of web services that help us develop and maintain our software in collaboration with the open source community, for example [translate.photoprism.app](https://translate.photoprism.app/).
    
    Because many of these apps and tools were originally developed for internal use without a high level of privacy in mind, we ask that you do not enter personal information such as your real name or personal email address if you want it to remain private.
    
    **Personal details may otherwise show up in logs, source code, translation files, commit messages, and pull request comments.**
