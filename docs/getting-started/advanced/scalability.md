# Deployment in High-Availability Environments and Horizontal Scaling in the Cloud

[Our team](https://www.photoprism.app/about/team) aims to [make effective use](../../developer-guide/code-quality.md#effectiveness-efficiency) of the resources available by prioritizing functionality that benefits as many users as possible. Since most users run PhotoPrism at home on NAS devices or on small cloud server instances, our public documentation and development efforts therefore focus on these types of environments and usage scenarios.

So while our freely available [Community Edition](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism) works well even with millions of files when hosted on an appropriately sized server that [meets the system requirements](../index.md#system-requirements) (*vertical scaling*), you should be aware that the architecture and feature set would look different in some aspects – with other trade-offs being made – if the focus was on *high availability* and *horizontal scaling* in a cloud hosting environment. For example, you might prefer to split the backend into independently scalable microservices and not use a regular file system as storage for indexing.

As an enterprise customer with specific scalability and performance requirements, you are welcome to [contact us for a free consultation](https://www.photoprism.app/contact) to determine feasibility and implementation effort.
